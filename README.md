# MasterThesis
This repository contains the referenced additionally produced files within the Master's Thesis: "Evaluation of water quality changes in African lakes in response to climate trends and extreme events based on satellite and meteo-climatic data" conducted at CNR IREA under the supervision of Professor Francesco Fava and Monica Pinardi, submitted on Nov. 27th, 2023 in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of "Environmental Change and Global Sustainability (ECGS)" at the University of Milan, Italy.

Outputs include
- Water Quality Products retrieved from Sentinel-3 data of the Lakes CCI dataset (specifically from the ECV LWLR -> Chlorophyll-a and Turbidity)
- Water Quality Products retrieved from Sentinel-2 data processed with ACOLITE in case of eutrophic state or higher and with C2RCC in case of less productive  waters 
- Exemplary settings files for the processers
- Plots of timeseries of meteo-climatic and water quality variables in various temporal resolutions (daily, monthly, yearly) 
- And others as specified within the thesis' text.

Should any referenced outputs be absent, a pull request can be issued leading to the delivery of the missing outputs.
